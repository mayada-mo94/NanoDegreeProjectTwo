# Would You Rather

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

The starter code will consist of a _DATA.js file, which represents a fake database and contains methods that let you access the data

## Usage

The project can be run with

- `npm start`

The project can be viewed in the browser at

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
